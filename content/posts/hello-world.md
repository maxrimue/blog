# Hello World!

Welcome to my **first blog post** using Nuxt Content.

This is a paragraph demonstrating basic markdown. You can add more content here like:

- Lists
- Code blocks
- Images (make sure to handle assets correctly, often placing them in the `public/` directory)

```bash
echo "bla bla bla"
```
