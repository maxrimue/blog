# Hello World!

Welcome to my **first blog post**!

Unfortunately, there's nothing to see here yet in terms of posts. However, look at this cool technical demo of formatting Markdown:

- Lists
- Code blocks

```bash
echo "Syntax highlighting works!"
```

```ts
const message = "Hello, world!";
console.log(message);
```
